During this game project development I have learned a lot.
I think that the most valuable knowledge that I got was reducing amount of time
by using new methods such as for loops, arrays, object etc. Moreover, I have learned 
how to deal with issues and that sometimes it is good to start some parts again as
many times the issue was not suitable name(it could be too long or too many special
characters were used). I am really proud from my graphics that I have developed such as
background, mountains.
My extension is based on more developed game mechanics such as platforms and enemies as
well as the graphical concept. I have learned more about "this" and how to split the work
into smaller chunks so functions, objects have their own place in the code.
