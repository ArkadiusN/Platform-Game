# Platform-Game
The purpose of this project was to develop a platform theme game that would suit itself inside of most browsers by utlizing a JavaScript and HTML. In addition, the p5.js lirary has been used for the advantage of this project.
The key lessons from this project are:
1. To understand and learm concept of loops, array, objects (OOP).
2. To deal with common errors.
3. Use of "this" keyword
4. Decomposition of tasks.

The results are a working version of the game, however with few errors such as:
1. No instant reset of heart afte falling to pit.
2. No ending at the end of map
3. Not getting on the platform and getting the score from points on platform.
